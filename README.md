# MUTARA
This assignment, which is for Biomedical Informatics is an implementation of the MUTARA algorithm. However for this assignment
It is to mine data that does not have temporal data. The data used was FDAâ€™s spontaneous reports.
It made it impossible for this to be an complete implementation.

Also instead of some optimizations, simplicity was necessary due to partner for this project not being familiar with code
